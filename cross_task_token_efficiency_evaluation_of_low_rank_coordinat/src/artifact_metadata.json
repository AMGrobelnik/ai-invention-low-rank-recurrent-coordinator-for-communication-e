  "title": "Cross-Task Token Efficiency Evaluation of Low-Rank Coordinator",
  "summary": "This evaluation artifact validates the hypothesis that the Low-Rank Recurrent Coordinator achieves statistically significant token reduction while maintaining task performance. Using data from two dependency experiments (exp_2_006 and exp_3_011), the evaluation analyzed 200 coordination tasks from the LMSYS chatbot arena dataset. Key findings: 1.23% token reduction (3.93 tokens per episode), maintained accuracy (52.5% for both baseline and method), statistical significance (p=7.17e-48), and large effect size (Cohen's d=1.38). Optimal rank identified as 8 with diminishing returns beyond this value. The evaluation includes comprehensive metrics aggregation and per-example predictions with token usage details. Downstream artifacts can use this to: (1) validate token efficiency claims in multi-LLM coordination settings, (2) guide rank selection for deployment (use rank=8), (3) compare against other compression methods using the standardized metrics_agg format, and (4) analyze per-task token savings patterns from the 200 annotated examples in full_eval_out.json."
