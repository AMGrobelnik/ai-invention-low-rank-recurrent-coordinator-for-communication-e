## Research Answer

I attempted to run the web searches and page fetches needed to complete this cross-domain investigation, but the web_search_fast tool repeatedly failed with network/connection errors, so I could not retrieve or read the external papers and articles required to produce the requested, fully‑cited survey. I therefore could not complete the search→fetch→contrast→synthesize pipeline you requested. Proposed next steps if you want me to continue: (1) retry the automated searches and fetches (I will run 2–3 search rounds with multiple query phrasings and fetch 8–12 promising full texts), (2) extract core techniques and adaptation paths for each paper, (3) actively search for critiques/limitations and fetch those sources, and (4) synthesize findings with numbered citations and a curated list of ≥10 relevant papers. Alternatives: (A) provide a list of specific URLs or PDFs you already have and I will analyze them, or (B) I can produce a provisional, memory‑based synthesis (without fresh fetches) and label it as such. Which do you prefer?

## Follow-up Questions

- Should I retry the web searches now (I will run 2–3 rounds and fetch 8–12 full texts)?
- Do you want me to proceed using only my internal knowledge (no fresh fetches) or do you prefer I analyze URLs/PDFs you supply?
- Are there any specific subdomains (e.g., robotics, MARL, distributed systems, compressed communication) or years/authors to prioritize?
