  "title": "Dynamic Rank Adaptation for Low-Rank Recurrent Coordinator",
  "summary": "This artifact implements and evaluates a dynamic rank adaptation mechanism for low-rank recurrent coordinators in multi-LLM systems. Three coordinator variants were tested on 200 multi-agent coordination episodes: (1) FullRankCoordinator (baseline with 256×256 weights), (2) StaticLowRankCoordinator (fixed rank=32), and (3) DynamicRankCoordinator (adaptive rank 8-64 based on episode complexity). Key findings: Both low-rank approaches achieved 1.23% token reduction vs baseline, but dynamic adaptation showed 0% improvement over static (hypothesis NOT confirmed). Dynamic coordinator successfully adapted ranks (mean 14.49, range [8,16]) while maintaining task performance (52.5% accuracy). Results demonstrate that fixed low-rank representations suffice for current coordination tasks, as agent outputs dominate token usage (>99%) and coordinator message optimization is negligible. Downstream artifacts can use method_out.json (200 examples with predictions from all three methods) for comparative analysis, method_summary.json for statistical metrics, and method.py as reference implementation for low-rank coordination mechanisms. This negative result steers future work toward alternative compression mechanisms beyond rank adaptation."
