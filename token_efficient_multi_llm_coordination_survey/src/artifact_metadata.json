  "title": "Token\u2011Efficient Multi\u2011LLM Coordination Survey",
  "summary": "Surveyed the located literature and found three complementary directions relevant to reducing token usage in multi\u2011LLM coordination: modular sparse recurrence (RIMs) for selective updating/communication [7,8], Long\u2192Short reasoning compression (TokenSqueeze) for compressing chains\u2011of\u2011thought [1\u20133], and hierarchical context/latent compression (CCF) for compact long\u2011context representations [4\u20136]. However, TokenSqueeze and CCF are currently available as preprints and there is no peer\u2011reviewed, integrated evaluation combining all three on a multi\u2011agent token\u2011efficiency benchmark in the retrieved material; this gap motivates end\u2011to\u2011end experiments that ablate each component and report per\u2011turn token budgets and task fidelity. The provided sources give architectures and preliminary empirical claims to use as baselines, but independent reproduction and benchmarked evaluations are needed for firm conclusions."
