  "title": "Multi-LLM Agent Interaction Dataset for Coordination Research",
  "summary": "This artifact contains a curated dataset of 200 multi-LLM agent interaction episodes from the lmsys/chatbot_arena_conversations benchmark. Each example includes: (1) user input prompts, (2) responses from two different language models (model_a and model_b), (3) human-evaluated performance metrics (winner designation and judge ID), (4) metadata including language, turn number, and conversation context. The dataset was selected as the best candidate for training low-rank recurrent coordinators because it provides actual multi-agent interactions with ground-truth task outcomes. Key outputs include data_out.json (main dataset, 200 examples), full_data_out.json (identical copy), mini_data_out.json (3 examples for testing), and preview_data_out.json (3 examples with truncated strings for inspection). Downstream artifacts can use this data to: compute per-turn token usage via tokenizers, extract latent representations from conversation states, train compression models, and evaluate token reduction strategies. The standardized schema (exp_sel_data_out.json) ensures compatibility with experiment pipelines. All files validated and under GitHub's 100MB size limit."
