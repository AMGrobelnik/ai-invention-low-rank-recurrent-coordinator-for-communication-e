  "question": "Identify and synthesize all peer\u2011reviewed methods published after 2022 that aim to reduce token usage in multi\u2011LLM coordination, including their architectural details, communication protocols, and reported performance on benchmark datasets such as the Multi\u2011Agent Coordination Communication\u2011Efficiency dataset.",
  "answer": "High-level conclusion: There are relatively few peer\u2011reviewed works published after 2022 that directly propose and evaluate token\u2011efficient coordination mechanisms for multi\u2011LLM systems; instead, the recent literature consists mainly of (a) older, peer\u2011reviewed modular/sparse recurrence ideas that can be repurposed for coordination (RIMs) [7,8], and (b) very recent preprints/proposals for Long\u2192Short reasoning compression (TokenSqueeze) and hierarchical context/latent compression (CCF) that target token efficiency but are (so far) available as arXiv / openreview preprints rather than mature, peer\u2011reviewed multi\u2011LLM coordination studies [1\u20136].\n\nKey methods and how they relate to token\u2011efficient multi\u2011LLM coordination:\n1) Recurrent Independent Mechanisms (RIMs) \u2013 modular sparse recurrence: RIMs propose multiple nearly\u2011independent recurrent modules with sparse, dynamic communication and selective activation, enabling selective updates and reduced cross\u2011module traffic; RIMs are a foundational architectural idea that can be used to build low\u2011communication coordinators for multi\u2011agent LLM systems [7,8].\n2) TokenSqueeze (Long\u2192Short training / reasoning compression): TokenSqueeze introduces a training\u2011time Long2Short compression method that learns to condense reasoning traces to much shorter summaries while attempting to preserve downstream reasoning accuracy; the authors report substantial token reductions in their experiments while maintaining performance on their benchmarks, but the work currently appears as preprints/openreview materials rather than established, peer\u2011reviewed multi\u2011agent evaluations [1\u20133].\n3) CCF (Context Compression Framework) \u2013 hierarchical latent compression: CCF proposes learned hierarchical latent context representations (compress / expand) to represent long contexts compactly; this reduces token payloads needed to represent long histories and is directly relevant to reducing inter\u2011agent message sizes, but the proposals are currently presented as recent preprints rather than widely validated peer\u2011reviewed coordination studies [4\u20136].\n\nArchitectural & protocol details (summary from sources):\n- RIMs: multiple recurrent modules with independent state, attention\u2011based selective communication gating, and sparse activation so only a subset of modules transmit/receive at each step \u2014 this produces sparser inter\u2011module messages and a natural way to limit bandwidth between agents or between agents and a coordinator [7,8].\n- TokenSqueeze: a preference\u2011learning / training\u2011time objective that encourages a model to emit compressed reasoning traces (shorter token sequences that retain decision\u2011relevant information), combined with evaluation showing token savings with preserved accuracy on the authors' benchmarks [1\u20133].\n- CCF: hierarchical encoder(s) that learn latent summaries at multiple granularities and selectively expand parts of the latent context when needed, enabling a compact representation to be passed between agents/coordinator and expanded locally when necessary [4\u20136].\n\nReported performance and datasets: \n- TokenSqueeze papers report significant Long\u2192Short token reductions while keeping reasoning accuracy close to uncompressed baselines on the experiments they present; however, these results are reported in the TokenSqueeze preprints / openreview materials rather than in a peer\u2011reviewed venue and are not reported specifically on public multi\u2011LLM coordination benchmarks such as the Multi\u2011Agent Coordination Communication\u2011Efficiency dataset [1\u20133].\n- CCF papers claim improved efficiency for long\u2011context modeling and show compression effects in their preprint evaluations, but do not (in the sources located) present direct evaluations on community multi\u2011LLM coordination benchmarks [4,5].\n- RIMs demonstrate benefits for modular dynamics and sparse communication in sequential tasks (published earlier), but do not by themselves provide numeric token\u2011savings on modern multi\u2011LLM coordination benchmarks in the papers found here [7,8].\n\nSupporting evidence: the preprints and RIMs foundational work together point to three complementary directions (sparse modular recurrence, learned Long\u2192Short compression, and hierarchical latent context compression) that are directly applicable to token\u2011efficient multi\u2011LLM coordination [1\u20138].\n\nContradicting/limiting evidence and gaps:\n- Lack of peer\u2011reviewed, end\u2011to\u2011end evaluations: none of the located sources report a joint, peer\u2011reviewed empirical evaluation that integrates RIMs\u2011style low\u2011rank coordinators, CCF\u2011style latent compression, and TokenSqueeze fine\u2011tuning into an end\u2011to\u2011end multi\u2011LLM coordinator evaluated on a standard multi\u2011agent token\u2011efficiency benchmark [1\u20136,7\u20139].\n- Preprint status: the two main modern techniques (TokenSqueeze and CCF) are available as arXiv/openreview preprints in the retrieved material; their claims look promising but should be treated as preliminary until peer\u2011review and broader reproduction are available [1\u20136].\n- Missing standard multi\u2011LLM benchmark results: the sources do not report results on the specific Multi\u2011Agent Coordination Communication\u2011Efficiency dataset (no paper in the located set reports evaluations on that dataset), so concrete baseline numbers for token cost vs. task performance are not available in these sources [1\u20136,9].\n\nPractical implications and recommended baselines for future experiments:\n- Use RIMs (sparse modular recurrence) as the structural prior for a low\u2011rank coordinator to reduce per\u2011turn message traffic [7,8].\n- Apply TokenSqueeze Long\u2192Short training to inter\u2011agent messages and chains\u2011of\u2011thought to shrink token payloads while monitoring downstream reasoning fidelity [1\u20133].\n- Use CCF hierarchical latent compression to represent long conversation/history contexts compactly and selectively expand at the coordinator or agent when needed [4\u20136].\n- Evaluate all components (and ablations) on a dataset that records per\u2011turn token counts (e.g., the Multi\u2011Agent Coordination Communication\u2011Efficiency dataset described in project artifacts) because none of the located papers report results on that benchmark; this will produce the necessary baseline comparisons missing from current literature [1\u20139].\n\nConfidence and what would change it: \n- Current confidence: moderate that the three directions (RIMs, TokenSqueeze, CCF) are the most relevant and complementary recent approaches for reducing token usage in multi\u2011LLM coordination given the located literature, but low confidence that any of them has yet been proven in a peer\u2011reviewed, integrated multi\u2011LLM coordinator evaluation (because TokenSqueeze and CCF are preprints and no joint evaluations were found) [1\u20136,7\u20139].\n- Evidence that would raise confidence: peer\u2011reviewed publications or reproduced code+benchmarks showing integrated experiments (RIMs + TokenSqueeze + CCF) with token\u2011budgeted metrics on a multi\u2011LLM coordination dataset; broader independent replications of TokenSqueeze/CCF results; or explicit papers reporting token\u2011savings on standard multi\u2011agent coordination benchmarks [1\u20139].\n\nShort answer to the research question: After 2022, there are not yet many peer\u2011reviewed papers that directly target token\u2011efficient multi\u2011LLM coordination as a single, evaluated goal; instead, the literature contains (i) foundational modular recurrence work (RIMs, earlier peer\u2011reviewed) and (ii) very recent preprints proposing TokenSqueeze and CCF compression techniques that are promising building blocks but lack integrated, peer\u2011reviewed multi\u2011LLM coordination evaluations and benchmark results on the Multi\u2011Agent Coordination Communication\u2011Efficiency dataset in the retrieved material [1\u20139].",

    "Can TokenSqueeze and CCF be integrated with a RIMs\u2011style low\u2011dimensional coordinator and evaluated end\u2011to\u2011end on the Multi\u2011Agent Coordination Communication\u2011Efficiency dataset to produce concrete token\u2011vs\u2011performance baselines?",
    "How do token\u2011saving methods (TokenSqueeze, CCF) affect emergent coordination failure modes (e.g., loss of important context, hallucination) when deployed in multi\u2011LLM pipelines?",
    "Are there peer\u2011reviewed implementations or independent reproductions of TokenSqueeze or CCF results, and how do their token\u2011savings hold up across different model sizes and agent counts?"
  ],
  "summary": "Surveyed the located literature and found three complementary directions relevant to reducing token usage in multi\u2011LLM coordination: modular sparse recurrence (RIMs) for selective updating/communication [7,8], Long\u2192Short reasoning compression (TokenSqueeze) for compressing chains\u2011of\u2011thought [1\u20133], and hierarchical context/latent compression (CCF) for compact long\u2011context representations [4\u20136]. However, TokenSqueeze and CCF are currently available as preprints and there is no peer\u2011reviewed, integrated evaluation combining all three on a multi\u2011agent token\u2011efficiency benchmark in the retrieved material; this gap motivates end\u2011to\u2011end experiments that ablate each component and report per\u2011turn token budgets and task fidelity. The provided sources give architectures and preliminary empirical claims to use as baselines, but independent reproduction and benchmarked evaluations are needed for firm conclusions.",
