  "title": "Comprehensive Evaluation of Low-Rank Coordinator Metrics",
  "summary": "This artifact provides a systematic evaluation of the low-rank recurrent coordinator for multi-LLM agent communication efficiency. The evaluation assessed 200 examples from the lmsys/chatbot_arena_conversations dataset, comparing a full-rank baseline coordinator against a low-rank coordinator with RIM-inspired sparse recurrence (rank=32, hidden_dim=256). Key findings: (1) Token efficiency - achieved 12.33% mean token savings, below the 20% target, with savings varying by interaction complexity (low: 27.8%, medium: 7.5%, high: 6.5%); (2) Task performance - maintained identical accuracy (52.5%) and F1 scores between baseline and low-rank methods; (3) Robustness - 100% prediction agreement rate demonstrating high consistency; (4) Statistical significance - token reduction is statistically significant (p<0.05) but with negligible effect size (Cohen's d=0.017). Outputs include comprehensive metrics (token efficiency, performance, robustness, statistical tests), visualizations (token savings by complexity, performance comparison), and actionable recommendations. Downstream artifacts can use these results to guide architectural refinements, explore alternative compression strategies, or test with longer multi-turn interactions where coordinator overhead compounds."
