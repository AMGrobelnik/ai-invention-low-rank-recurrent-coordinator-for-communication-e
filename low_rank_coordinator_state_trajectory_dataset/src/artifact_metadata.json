  "title": "Multi-LLM State Prediction Reference Dataset",
  "summary": "Created a curated reference dataset for multi-LLM hidden-state trajectory research. Selected and processed LangAGI-Lab/human_eval-next_state_prediction_w_gpt4o dataset containing 200 web agent state transition examples with multi-model predictions (3 LLMs: proprietary model, GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-4o). Each example includes current state observations, objectives, predicted next states from multiple models, and ground truth outcomes. The dataset demonstrates state transition tracking and multi-LLM comparison patterns, providing a template for designing novel datasets that capture coordinator hidden states, token usage metrics, and performance tracking. Key outputs include data_out.json (640KB, 200 examples), plus mini (3 examples) and preview (truncated) versions for quick inspection. All files validated against exp_sel_data_out.json schema. Downstream artifacts can use this as a reference for schema design, multi-model comparison structure, and state representation format when building the proposed multi-LLM hidden-state trajectory dataset with 250 interaction episodes."
