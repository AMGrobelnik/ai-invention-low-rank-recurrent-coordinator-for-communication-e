  "title": "Low-Rank Recurrent Coordinator Empirical Evaluation Results",
  "summary": "This artifact contains the complete implementation and experimental results of a low-rank recurrent coordinator for multi-LLM agent communication efficiency. The experiment compared a baseline full-rank coordinator (256×256 parameters) against a low-rank coordinator (rank=32, 4 RIM modules, 25% parameters) on 200 multi-agent interactions from the lmsys/chatbot_arena_conversations dataset. Key outputs include: (1) method_out.json with per-example predictions from both baseline and low-rank methods, (2) method_summary.json with aggregated metrics showing 1.23% token reduction (statistically significant p<0.0001 but below 15% target), 52.5% accuracy maintained for both methods, and (3) comprehensive DEBUG logs in method_execution.log. The implementation uses numpy/scipy for CPU-only execution with tiktoken for token counting, includes 15 try/except blocks for error handling, and follows the exp_gen_sol_out.json schema. Downstream artifacts can use this data to: analyze per-example token savings patterns, identify cases where low-rank compression is effective, tune hyperparameters (rank, num_modules), or implement alternative compression strategies. The hypothesis was NOT CONFIRMED: low-rank coordination achieved only 1.23% token reduction versus the 15% target, revealing practical limits of low-rank compression in this coordinator architecture."
