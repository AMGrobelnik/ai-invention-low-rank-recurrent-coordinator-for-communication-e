  "title": "Rank-Ablation Study of Low-Rank Recurrent Coordinator",
  "summary": "This artifact contains a systematic rank-ablation study evaluating how coordinator dimensionality (rank) affects token-efficiency and task performance in multi-LLM coordination systems. The experiment tested 5 rank values [8, 16, 32, 64, 128] against a full-rank baseline on 200 multi-agent coordination examples from the Extended Multi-LLM Coordination Dataset with Token-Usage Annotations. Key outputs include: (1) method_out.json with predictions from both baseline and low-rank coordinators, (2) method_summary.json with comprehensive metrics and statistical analysis, (3) rank_ablation_plots.png visualizing trade-off curves, and (4) ANALYSIS_REPORT.md documenting findings and failure modes. Results show that token reduction is constant at 1.23% across all ranks, independent of rank value, with performance maintained at 52.5% accuracy. The hypothesis was NOT validated (target >15% reduction). Critical finding: rank is not the controlling variable for token efficiency; the message generation mechanism requires redesign. Downstream artifacts can use this to: understand rank-performance trade-offs, identify architectural bottlenecks in coordinator design, and guide future implementations toward adaptive message encoding schemes."
