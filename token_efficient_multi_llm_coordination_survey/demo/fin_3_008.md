## Research Answer

High-level conclusion: There are relatively few peer‑reviewed works published after 2022 that directly propose and evaluate token‑efficient coordination mechanisms for multi‑LLM systems; instead, the recent literature consists mainly of (a) older, peer‑reviewed modular/sparse recurrence ideas that can be repurposed for coordination (RIMs) [7,8], and (b) very recent preprints/proposals for Long→Short reasoning compression (TokenSqueeze) and hierarchical context/latent compression (CCF) that target token efficiency but are (so far) available as arXiv / openreview preprints rather than mature, peer‑reviewed multi‑LLM coordination studies [1–6].

Key methods and how they relate to token‑efficient multi‑LLM coordination:
1) Recurrent Independent Mechanisms (RIMs) – modular sparse recurrence: RIMs propose multiple nearly‑independent recurrent modules with sparse, dynamic communication and selective activation, enabling selective updates and reduced cross‑module traffic; RIMs are a foundational architectural idea that can be used to build low‑communication coordinators for multi‑agent LLM systems [7,8].
2) TokenSqueeze (Long→Short training / reasoning compression): TokenSqueeze introduces a training‑time Long2Short compression method that learns to condense reasoning traces to much shorter summaries while attempting to preserve downstream reasoning accuracy; the authors report substantial token reductions in their experiments while maintaining performance on their benchmarks, but the work currently appears as preprints/openreview materials rather than established, peer‑reviewed multi‑agent evaluations [1–3].
3) CCF (Context Compression Framework) – hierarchical latent compression: CCF proposes learned hierarchical latent context representations (compress / expand) to represent long contexts compactly; this reduces token payloads needed to represent long histories and is directly relevant to reducing inter‑agent message sizes, but the proposals are currently presented as recent preprints rather than widely validated peer‑reviewed coordination studies [4–6].

Architectural & protocol details (summary from sources):
- RIMs: multiple recurrent modules with independent state, attention‑based selective communication gating, and sparse activation so only a subset of modules transmit/receive at each step — this produces sparser inter‑module messages and a natural way to limit bandwidth between agents or between agents and a coordinator [7,8].
- TokenSqueeze: a preference‑learning / training‑time objective that encourages a model to emit compressed reasoning traces (shorter token sequences that retain decision‑relevant information), combined with evaluation showing token savings with preserved accuracy on the authors' benchmarks [1–3].
- CCF: hierarchical encoder(s) that learn latent summaries at multiple granularities and selectively expand parts of the latent context when needed, enabling a compact representation to be passed between agents/coordinator and expanded locally when necessary [4–6].

Reported performance and datasets: 
- TokenSqueeze papers report significant Long→Short token reductions while keeping reasoning accuracy close to uncompressed baselines on the experiments they present; however, these results are reported in the TokenSqueeze preprints / openreview materials rather than in a peer‑reviewed venue and are not reported specifically on public multi‑LLM coordination benchmarks such as the Multi‑Agent Coordination Communication‑Efficiency dataset [1–3].
- CCF papers claim improved efficiency for long‑context modeling and show compression effects in their preprint evaluations, but do not (in the sources located) present direct evaluations on community multi‑LLM coordination benchmarks [4,5].
- RIMs demonstrate benefits for modular dynamics and sparse communication in sequential tasks (published earlier), but do not by themselves provide numeric token‑savings on modern multi‑LLM coordination benchmarks in the papers found here [7,8].

Supporting evidence: the preprints and RIMs foundational work together point to three complementary directions (sparse modular recurrence, learned Long→Short compression, and hierarchical latent context compression) that are directly applicable to token‑efficient multi‑LLM coordination [1–8].

Contradicting/limiting evidence and gaps:
- Lack of peer‑reviewed, end‑to‑end evaluations: none of the located sources report a joint, peer‑reviewed empirical evaluation that integrates RIMs‑style low‑rank coordinators, CCF‑style latent compression, and TokenSqueeze fine‑tuning into an end‑to‑end multi‑LLM coordinator evaluated on a standard multi‑agent token‑efficiency benchmark [1–6,7–9].
- Preprint status: the two main modern techniques (TokenSqueeze and CCF) are available as arXiv/openreview preprints in the retrieved material; their claims look promising but should be treated as preliminary until peer‑review and broader reproduction are available [1–6].
- Missing standard multi‑LLM benchmark results: the sources do not report results on the specific Multi‑Agent Coordination Communication‑Efficiency dataset (no paper in the located set reports evaluations on that dataset), so concrete baseline numbers for token cost vs. task performance are not available in these sources [1–6,9].

Practical implications and recommended baselines for future experiments:
- Use RIMs (sparse modular recurrence) as the structural prior for a low‑rank coordinator to reduce per‑turn message traffic [7,8].
- Apply TokenSqueeze Long→Short training to inter‑agent messages and chains‑of‑thought to shrink token payloads while monitoring downstream reasoning fidelity [1–3].
- Use CCF hierarchical latent compression to represent long conversation/history contexts compactly and selectively expand at the coordinator or agent when needed [4–6].
- Evaluate all components (and ablations) on a dataset that records per‑turn token counts (e.g., the Multi‑Agent Coordination Communication‑Efficiency dataset described in project artifacts) because none of the located papers report results on that benchmark; this will produce the necessary baseline comparisons missing from current literature [1–9].

Confidence and what would change it: 
- Current confidence: moderate that the three directions (RIMs, TokenSqueeze, CCF) are the most relevant and complementary recent approaches for reducing token usage in multi‑LLM coordination given the located literature, but low confidence that any of them has yet been proven in a peer‑reviewed, integrated multi‑LLM coordinator evaluation (because TokenSqueeze and CCF are preprints and no joint evaluations were found) [1–6,7–9].
- Evidence that would raise confidence: peer‑reviewed publications or reproduced code+benchmarks showing integrated experiments (RIMs + TokenSqueeze + CCF) with token‑budgeted metrics on a multi‑LLM coordination dataset; broader independent replications of TokenSqueeze/CCF results; or explicit papers reporting token‑savings on standard multi‑agent coordination benchmarks [1–9].

Short answer to the research question: After 2022, there are not yet many peer‑reviewed papers that directly target token‑efficient multi‑LLM coordination as a single, evaluated goal; instead, the literature contains (i) foundational modular recurrence work (RIMs, earlier peer‑reviewed) and (ii) very recent preprints proposing TokenSqueeze and CCF compression techniques that are promising building blocks but lack integrated, peer‑reviewed multi‑LLM coordination evaluations and benchmark results on the Multi‑Agent Coordination Communication‑Efficiency dataset in the retrieved material [1–9].

## Follow-up Questions

- Can TokenSqueeze and CCF be integrated with a RIMs‑style low‑dimensional coordinator and evaluated end‑to‑end on the Multi‑Agent Coordination Communication‑Efficiency dataset to produce concrete token‑vs‑performance baselines?
- How do token‑saving methods (TokenSqueeze, CCF) affect emergent coordination failure modes (e.g., loss of important context, hallucination) when deployed in multi‑LLM pipelines?
- Are there peer‑reviewed implementations or independent reproductions of TokenSqueeze or CCF results, and how do their token‑savings hold up across different model sizes and agent counts?
