  "question": "Identify and synthesize recent research on low-rank recurrent architectures for coordination in domains such as multi-agent reinforcement learning, robotics, and distributed systems, focusing on token/communication efficiency mechanisms applicable to LLM agents.",
  "answer": "I attempted to run the web searches and page fetches needed to complete this cross-domain investigation, but the web_search_fast tool repeatedly failed with network/connection errors, so I could not retrieve or read the external papers and articles required to produce the requested, fully\u2011cited survey. I therefore could not complete the search\u2192fetch\u2192contrast\u2192synthesize pipeline you requested. Proposed next steps if you want me to continue: (1) retry the automated searches and fetches (I will run 2\u20133 search rounds with multiple query phrasings and fetch 8\u201312 promising full texts), (2) extract core techniques and adaptation paths for each paper, (3) actively search for critiques/limitations and fetch those sources, and (4) synthesize findings with numbered citations and a curated list of \u226510 relevant papers. Alternatives: (A) provide a list of specific URLs or PDFs you already have and I will analyze them, or (B) I can produce a provisional, memory\u2011based synthesis (without fresh fetches) and label it as such. Which do you prefer?",

    "Should I retry the web searches now (I will run 2\u20133 rounds and fetch 8\u201312 full texts)?",
    "Do you want me to proceed using only my internal knowledge (no fresh fetches) or do you prefer I analyze URLs/PDFs you supply?",
    "Are there any specific subdomains (e.g., robotics, MARL, distributed systems, compressed communication) or years/authors to prioritize?"

  "summary": "Automated web search/fetch tools failed (connection errors), so I could not retrieve the external literature to perform the requested cross\u2011domain survey. I propose either retrying the searches (recommended), analyzing user\u2011provided documents, or producing a provisional internal\u2011knowledge summary. Once you confirm, I will run the full search\u2192fetch\u2192contrast\u2192synthesize process and produce the final, fully\u2011cited JSON report.",
