  "title": "Low\u2011Rank Coordinators and Token Compression",
  "summary": "Surveyed three complementary lines: modular sparse recurrence (RIMs) for selective updates and sparse communication [1], learned hierarchical context/latent compression (CCF) for compact long\u2011context representations [3], and token\u2011level Long\u2192Short training (TokenSqueeze) for large token savings while preserving reasoning accuracy [2]. None of the sources present an end\u2011to\u2011end multi\u2011LLM coordinator combining all three, so the main gap is integrated empirical evaluation. Recommended next experiments: build a RIMs\u2011style low\u2011dimensional coordinator, add CCF\u2011style latent compression, fine\u2011tune inter\u2011agent messages with TokenSqueeze methods, and evaluate token cost vs task performance across ablations. Downstream artifacts can use these components as modular building blocks and should prioritize creating multi\u2011agent benchmarks that measure token budgets, latency, and decision fidelity. "
